> This is the editest of all editors

Well, not really, but that would be cool I guess.

This is a super simple image editor which lets you add some quick effects and filters to your images.

Usage
=====
Just click the "Upload" button then select the effect or filter you want to make.

Hover over the image to be reminded of what the original image was like (or tap and hold if you're mobile).

You can then click the download button to download the result.

You cannot mix and match effects and filters right now though, you can work around that by downloading the image after the first effect then upload the result for the second round (or just settle on the one you like the most :D)
